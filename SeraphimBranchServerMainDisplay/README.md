# SeraphimBranchServerMainDisplay

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run-script build` The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/app`. TS errors may appear not finding mappings, this is fine. To manually run the built server run `node server.js`.

## Build Standalone Executable

Run `npm run-script build-exe`, this will build an executable for the current host platform.

## Angular Serve

Run `npm run-script ng-aot-server` This will run the angular server uting the Ahead of time compiler. Useful for development. Does not build to dist, this is a dev function only.

## Angular only build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
